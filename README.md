# Objective
The objective for this investigation is to assess the utility of mapping libraries like AutoMapper in .NET applications. This exploration aims to offer developers a comprehensive view of the benefits and limitations of mapping libraries. By presenting practical examples and performance benchmarks in C#, the goal is to empower developers to make informed choices about employing these tools effectively in their projects.
# About 
By running this example, you can observe and analyze the actual time differences between using different mapping libraries, demonstrating the trade-offs between convenience and performance in your application's mapping strategies. Adjust the example as needed based on your specific use case and performance testing requirements.
